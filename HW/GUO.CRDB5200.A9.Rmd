```{r}
library(XML)

```{r parseXML}
path <- "/Users/jacquelineguo/Documents/NEU/Spring 2022/CS5200/HW"

xmlDoc <- xmlParse(validate = F, file = paste(path, xmlFile, sep = "/"))
```

```{r}
xPathEx <- "//book[author='Galos, Mike']/title/text()|//catalog/book[author='Galos, Mike']/price/text()"
x <- xpathApply(xmlDoc, xPathEx)

print(x)
```

2. In what genre is the book with id "bk109".

```{r}
xPathEx <- "//book[@id='bk109']/genre/text()"
x <- xpathApply(xmlDoc, xPathEx)

print(x)
```

3. What are the titles of the books that sell for the lowest price? (Use the min aggregation function)

```{r}
xPathEx <- "//book[price=min(//book/price)]/title/text()"
x <- xpathApply(xmlDoc, xPathEx)

print(x)
```

4. List the title and prices of all books in the "Computer" genre.

```{r}
xPathEx <- "//book[genre='Computer']/title/text()|//book[genre='Computer']/price/text()"

print(x)
```

5. What is the number of all books that cost less than $5? (Use the count aggregation function)

```{r}
xPathEx <- "count(//book[price<5])"
x <- xpathApply(xmlDoc, xPathEx)

print(x)
```
